Abstract: 

This paper aims to elaborate a treated data set and apply the boosting
methodology to monthly Brazilian macroeconomic variables to check its predictability.
The forecasting performed here consists in using linear and nonlinear base-learners,
as well as a third type of model that has both linear and nonlinear components in the
estimation of the variables using the history itself with lag up to 12 periods. We want to
investigate which models and for which forecast horizons we have the strongest
performance. The results obtained here through different evaluation approaches point
out that, on average, the performance of boosting models using P-Splines as base-learner are the ones that
have the best results, especially the methodology with two components: two-stage boosting.
In addition, we conducted an analysis on a subgroup of variables with data available
until 2022 to verify the validity of our conclusions. We also compared the performance
of boosted trees with other models and evaluated model parameters using both cross-
validation and Akaike Information Criteria in order to check the robustness of the
results.
